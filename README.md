## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**Please Note**: Due to limited computational resources, this model is currently trained on a relatively small dataset with a short `sequence_length` of 10. As a result, its performance metrics are as follows:
- Accuracy: ~76%
- F1 Score: ~76%
- AUC: ~85%

While we are confident the results wil be promising after traning the model on a greater sequence length when we get access to additional computational resources, we strongly advise against using this project for serious or commercial applications in its current state. It serves best as a proof-of-concept and educational purposes.
